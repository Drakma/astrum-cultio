Progress through the different ages with this quest driven pack.  Follow the quest-lines to become master of each age to progress towards the stars.  This pack contains vein driving ore generation and a heavy influence on aesthetics.  This pack is meant to be light in mods but heavy in immersion.

### Stone Age

You notice that the trees are harder than normal and you can't just pull them down with your hands.  Find the tools needed to get your stone based tools to help you progress forward.  While better than wood tools, they're still not strong enough to mine those  more advanced minerals.

Build your first prospector tool to help local coal and Steaite.

### Steam Age

Steaite is the first mineral you'll need to progress into technology.  You'll be able to create steam based machinery to help you get started. Steam will help you start to automate ore processing, farming and much more.

Once you advanced in this age, you'll need to make a new prospector tool to help you find more advanced ores like tin and copper.

### Smelting Age

You'll need to figure out a way to get the ingredients for porcelain.  Porcelain is the main ingredient for everything you'll need in a smelter.  You'll also gain access to better tools.

### Astral Sorcery

Once you start the smelting age, you'll probably want to start astral sorcery as it will become imperative to progress into other ages. Starlight will be your best friend.

### Technology

As you progress and make better prospector tools, you'll discover better minerals that can be used to start creating better machinery.  You'll start wanting better power generation and you'll need to look into bio-fuels or diesel. 

### Mystical Agriculture

Ores are rare and require you to travel to find their veins.  Veins can be exhausted quickly and you'll need to turn to other methods of getting them.  Mystical Agriculture will be where you want to turn.

### Dimensional Mining

Some ores are only available in the mining dimension and you'll need to build the appropriate technology to advance any further.

### Reach for the Stars

If you've done everything right, it's time to visit the stars.  Build that rocket and make your way into space.

### Creative

I've always wanted to do some outlandishly complicated crafting.  We'll see where we go with the age (if anywhere)

##### This extremely alpha.  The main changes have been made to recipes and how different mods interact.  I don't anticipate any major mod changes.  For a lot of recipes, there have been some drastic changes.  As always, back up your worlds before updating the pack.

##### I have developed this pack with optifine installed.  I don't anticipate any major conflicts.  If something arises, I will do my best to squash it.  But, as always, disable optifine and try again if you run into an issue.
